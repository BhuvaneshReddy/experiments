How to use this folder
======================

The aim here is to test simple pages and make experiments with static files.
Create you folder and then run (if you have http-server installed through ```npm install http-server-g```:

```shell
$ http-server [pathname] [options]
```

To run locally, instead:

```shell
$ node bin/http-server [pathname] [options]
```

Then go to the address and test the project!
