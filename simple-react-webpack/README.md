This repo illustrates how to write React with ES6 in a minimal webpack configuration. For your convenience, webpack-dev-server is also present. Note that you do not need it: you might just generate the bundle and then load from your server using something like http-server.

To run this example:

```shell
npm start
```

Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Note that in order to make this project simple, we are using a minimal React Hot Reload config.
